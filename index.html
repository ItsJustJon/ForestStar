            <img src=".\Assets\images\jh_tree.jpeg" id="jonathan" alt="Jonathan Hummer professional image" />
            <p>I have spent the last fifteen years working in a variety of industries and have improved business performance with every role that I have undertaken, either through business process improvement, automated reporting, or software development with the Microsoft Office suite (Visual Basic for Applications). I now am concurrently a  computer programming student who aims to develop bespoke software for companies as part of a broader business consulting and automation partner.

            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <p>Because I am still on my journey learning modern programming languages and full-stack development, the projects listed below are currently conceptual only. Check in soon to see deployed projects based on assignments in my computer programming bootcamp or personal pet projects to practice what I have been learning.</p>

                <h3>Chinese Flashcards</h3>
                <img src="./assets/images/ka.png" alt="Chinese character for card, ka3"/>
                <p>A small program to practice character recognition of Traditional Chinese characters. My daughter has been learning Chinese and can read/recognize more than 50 characters, but studying from physical flashcards can be a bit unwieldy and doesn't allow for more frequent repetition of harder characters or less frequent review of "mastered" characters. (Not to mention the time that it takes me to create the flashcards!)</p>

        <h3>Why Choose Forest Star?</h3>
        <section class="tidbit">
            <h4>Experienced</h4>
            <p>Though I am new to full-stack development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, etc.), I have been computer programming for the past 15 years, largely in Visual Basic for Applications, so I understand programming logic and how your business processes apply to it. I have also worked extensively in the business world and know how business systems impact overall performance. My goal is to be where you go for when there <i>isn't</i> an "app for that".</p>
        </section>
        <section class="tidbit">
            <h4>Curious</h4>
            <p>I approach learning about business and industries with genuine curiosity and intellectual horsepower. I want to understand the things that make your particular business unique so that any implemented solutions are tailored to your exact business processes and operational nuances. While I bring a wealth of experience from various businesses and industries, I never assume that what worked in one place will work for you. And when things change, I'll be here to help your software and automation solutions adapt to those changes as well, so you'll never slip back into the ways things used to be done.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="tidbit">
            <h4>Driven</h4>
            <p>What satisfies me is when a user uses a software or automation solution and thinks (or says aloud!), "This is awesome! Why didn't I do this sooner!?" It is my purpose to make sure that every implementation is successful and drives real value in terms of time saved, errors reduced, and business aims achieved. I am not successful until you are successful, and I will work tirelessly to make sure that you are satisfied with the solutions that I provide.</p>
